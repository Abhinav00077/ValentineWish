### Step-by-step setup

1. **Fork the repository**  
   Click **Fork** on the top right of this repo so you have your own copy.

2. **Customize your wish**  
   Open `customize.json` in your fork and edit:

   | Field          | What to put |
   |----------------|-------------|
   | `name`         | Your friend’s name (or nickname) |
   | `greetingText` | A short greeting (e.g. *"I really like your name btw!"*) |
   | `wishText`     | Your Valentine’s message / wish |
   | `imagePath`    | Path to your image, e.g. `img/vector.jpg` (put your image in the `img/` folder and use its filename here) |

   Example:

   ```json
   {
     "name": "Priya",
     "greetingText": "Hey, you!",
     "wishText": "Hope your day is as amazing as you are. Happy Valentine's!",
     "imagePath": "img/vector.jpg"
   }
   ```

3. **Turn on GitHub Pages**  
   In your fork: **Settings → Pages**. Under **Source**, choose **Deploy from a branch**. Select branch **main** (or **master**) and folder **/ (root)**. Save. GitHub will show a URL once the site is published (usually within a minute).

4. **Share with your friend**  
   Your page URL will be:  
   **`https://<your-username>.github.io/ValentineWish/`**  
   Send this link to your friend.
